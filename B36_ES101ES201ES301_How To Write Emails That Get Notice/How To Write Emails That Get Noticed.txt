Sharing my experience 
Hello Team Masai,

I'm a student of Masai School, batch FT35, and my code is 228. I'm happy to share my experience from Masai's last unit. It was really good and challenging, but I learned a lot of things. The most important thing I learned was discipline, among many others. The course was well-structured, and the assignments really helped a lot.

Thatâ€™s it from my side. I'm glad to be a student of Masai School.

Thank you so much.

Regards,
Parveend Thakur
